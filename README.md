## Usage

To run the AI Trading Bot, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

The bot will start fetching real-time data and applying its trading strategies. You can monitor its performance through the logs generated in the terminal.

## How It Works

### Data Fetching

The bot connects to the Bitget API to retrieve real-time market data. This includes price, volume, and other relevant metrics.

### Predictive Analytics

Using a pretrained neural forecast model, the bot analyzes historical data to identify trends and generate signals. This model continuously learns from new data to improve its predictions.

### Trade Execution

Once the bot identifies a trading opportunity, it executes buy or sell orders based on predefined strategies. The execution is automated, allowing for quick response times to market changes.

### Monitoring and Adjustment

The bot includes a monitoring system that tracks its performance. Users can adjust parameters and strategies based on the bot's historical performance.
